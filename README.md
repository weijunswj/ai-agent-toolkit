# AI Skills Templates

A simple home for my reusable AI skills.

Each skill lives in a category folder. The category describes what the skill is mainly for.

## Folder layout

Current example:

```text
ai-skills-templates/
├── README.md
└── portfolio/
    ├── README.md
    └── knowledge-index-updater/
        ├── README.md
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── agents/
            ├── openai.yaml
            └── claude.md
```

Example with more categories:

```text
ai-skills-templates/
├── README.md
├── portfolio/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── knowledge-index-updater/
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── agents/
│           ├── openai.yaml
│           └── claude.md
├── finance/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── example-finance-skill/
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── agents/
│           ├── openai.yaml
│           └── claude.md
└── writing/
    ├── README.md
    └── example-writing-skill/
        ├── README.md
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── agents/
            ├── openai.yaml
            └── claude.md
```

The `finance/` and `writing/` folders above are examples only. Add them when there is a real skill for that category.

## What is a skill?

A skill is a small reusable instruction pack for an AI agent.

It tells the agent:

1. When to use the skill.
2. What tools or sources to check.
3. What steps to follow.
4. What output format to return.

Think of it like a tiny SOP for ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, Claude Code, or another agent.

## Default platform support

Every skill in this repo should support these platforms by default where possible:

| Platform | Default support |
|---|---|
| ChatGPT | Yes. Use `SKILL.md` plus `agents/openai.yaml`. |
| Codex | Yes. Copy the skill folder into the expected project skills location. |
| Claude | Yes, if Skills are enabled in the Claude account/workspace. Use the same `SKILL.md` folder. |
| Claude Code | Yes. Copy the skill folder into `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`. |

If a platform does not support a specific feature, document the limitation in the skill README and keep the main `SKILL.md` portable.

## Where can I use these skills?

You can use skills where your AI tool supports Agent Skills or ChatGPT Skills.

Common places:

1. ChatGPT Skills page, if your plan/workspace supports Skills.
2. Codex, by installing or copying a skill folder into the expected skills location.
3. Claude, if Skills are enabled and code execution is available.
4. Claude Code, by copying the skill folder into `~/.claude/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`.
5. API / custom agents, if your app supports loading Agent Skills.

Skills may not automatically sync between products, so treat this repo as the source copy.

## How to install a skill in ChatGPT

1. Open ChatGPT.
2. Click your profile icon.
3. Open **Skills**.
4. Choose **New skill**.
5. Upload or create the skill using the folder contents.
6. Test it with a real prompt.

If you do not see **Skills**, your plan or workspace may not support it yet.

## How to install a skill in Codex

Simple version:

1. Open the skill folder in this repo.
2. Copy the whole skill folder.
3. Put it in your project skills folder, such as `.agents/skills/`.
4. Restart Codex or reload the project.
5. Ask Codex to do a task that matches the skill.

Example:

```text
Use the knowledge index updater skill to update my Notion Knowledge Index.
```

## How to install a skill in Claude

Simple version:

1. Open Claude.
2. Go to settings for Skills if available.
3. Add or upload the skill folder.
4. Make sure code execution is enabled when the skill needs files, scripts, or tool-like behaviour.
5. Test it with a matching request.

If Claude Skills are not visible, the account, workspace, or plan may not support custom Skills yet.

## How to install a skill in Claude Code

Personal skill:

```text
~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
```

Project skill:

```text
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/
```

Simple version:

1. Copy the whole skill folder.
2. Paste it into `~/.claude/skills/` for personal use, or `.claude/skills/` inside a project.
3. Restart Claude Code.
4. Ask Claude Code to do a task that matches the skill.

Example:

```text
Use the knowledge index updater skill to update my Notion Knowledge Index.
```

## How to add a new skill to this repo

1. Pick a category folder.
2. Create the category folder if it does not exist yet.
3. Create a folder for the skill.
4. Add the skill files.
5. Add a `README.md` inside the skill folder.
6. Add platform notes under `agents/`:
   - `agents/openai.yaml` for ChatGPT/OpenAI metadata.
   - `agents/claude.md` for Claude and Claude Code notes.
7. Keep the README simple enough for an AI agent to understand quickly.

Example:

```text
finance/my-new-finance-skill/
├── README.md
├── SKILL.md
└── agents/
    ├── openai.yaml
    └── claude.md
```

## Current categories

| Category | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `portfolio` | Skills for portfolio pages, knowledge indexes, personal docs, and public/project references. |

## Example future categories

| Category | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `finance` | Skills for investing notes, trading workflows, portfolio tracking, and financial summaries. |
| `writing` | Skills for reusable writing workflows, editing, style guides, and content drafts. |
| `automation` | Skills for tool workflows, scheduled checks, scripts, and repeatable ops tasks. |
| `research` | Skills for source review, literature notes, competitive research, and structured summaries. |

Only create a category when there is at least one real skill to put inside it.

## Rules for this repo

1. Keep one folder per skill.
2. Keep skill folders small and readable.
3. Put agent-facing instructions in the skill folder README.
4. Keep install steps beginner-friendly.
5. Support ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, and Claude Code by default when possible.
6. Keep `SKILL.md` portable across agents.
7. Do not store secrets, tokens, private credentials, or sensitive exports here.
