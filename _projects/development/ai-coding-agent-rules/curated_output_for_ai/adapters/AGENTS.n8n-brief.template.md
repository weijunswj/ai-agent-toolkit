## n8n Agent Rules Adapter

If the task involves n8n workflows, workflow templates, helper scripts, MCP, import/export, live n8n, credentials, or workflow JSON, stop and load `skills/n8n-agent-rules` before planning or editing.
If that skill or its full rules are unavailable, stop and report the limitation instead of continuing.
Do not run live n8n, Docker, import/export, sync, activation, execution, publish/unpublish, credential, deployment, or production actions without explicit current-turn approval naming the target and allowed operation.
