## Source-of-Truth Contract

This repo has a source layer and a published layer.

- `_projects/**/_main/` preserves full source material and original docs. Do not casually rewrite preserved source.
- `_projects/**/curated_output_for_ai/` stores reviewed AI-facing source material. Curated files may be AI-assisted, but they are source files and must be reviewed before publishing.
- `_projects/**/toolkit.project.json` is the routing and toolkit project-version contract. It declares which `_main/` or `curated_output_for_ai/` files publish to `skills/` outputs.
- Toolkit project `version` is the toolkit adaptation/module version, uses `version_policy: "semver"`, and must not be replaced by Git tags, package tags, GitHub release tags, upstream versions, or per-file versions.
- `_projects/**/SOURCE-LOCK.json` records upstream/source provenance, exact source pins, blob pins, lifecycle, role, attribution requirement, and update policy.
- For third-party projects, `toolkit.project.json` version is the toolkit adaptation version only; scheduled source-watch tracking must read upstream repo, ref, locked commit, `source_update_policy`, attribution, allowlist, and blob pins from `SOURCE-LOCK.json`. Temporary actionable advisory targets may live in `repo/source-watch/advisory-targets.json` until implemented, rejected, or moved into SOURCE-LOCK tracking.
- Scheduled source-watch is PR-notification-only. It may compare active SOURCE-LOCK pins and actionable advisory targets with upstream GitHub commits, then open or refresh a stable review PR. It must not copy upstream files, change SOURCE-LOCK/advisory records, execute upstream code, auto-merge, push to main, run live n8n actions, or treat notification as approval. Real updates require a separate human-approved PR.
- `skills/` contains copyable AI-agent skill folders. The whole skill folder is the install unit.
- `.codex-plugin/` and `.claude-plugin/` contain generated native plugin metadata for the current Toolkit package. They are not source of truth and must not be used to cross-update the other native platform.
- Toolkit skill-routing source lives in `_projects/development/ai-coding-agent-rules/_main/_partials/toolkit-skill-routing.md`; keep it aligned with current `skills/*/SKILL.md` when skills or skill-publishing project modules change, and document any intentionally omitted skill.
- This repo intentionally does not ship or maintain a repo-wide MCP generated surface for now. [Official n8n Skills](https://github.com/n8n-io/skills) plus instance-level MCP references remain under `skills/n8n-local-setup/` as secondary n8n setup material.
- Generated published surfaces under `skills/`, `.codex-plugin/`, and `.claude-plugin/` must not be edited directly unless that output is explicitly declared as `linked`. Update the matching `_projects` source or curated file, then run sync.
- `linked` outputs are rare exceptions and must be explicitly declared with a reason in `toolkit.project.json`.
- Publish declared outputs with:
  `node repo/scripts/sync-toolkit-projects.cjs --write`
- Check generated freshness with:
  `node repo/scripts/sync-toolkit-projects.cjs --check`
- CI checks generated freshness from protected default-branch authority. Candidate-controlled auto-sync and generated-output writeback are retired.
- The protected repository-security authority checks out the exact candidate separately as inert data, runs exact protected generator bytes in an operation-owned directory, and compares the bounded expected-output manifest with candidate bytes.
- Generated fidelity binds the protected authority commit and tree, candidate head and tree, exact source-manifest digest, generator path and digest, dependency-lock digest, expected-output manifest digest, and comparison result.
- The protected generator receives no candidate workflow, controller, action, test, App token, repository write token, secret, commit path, push path, or writeback fallback.
- A generated mismatch fails the check and leaves regeneration to the PR author or coding agent. Generated outputs remain committed source-controlled files produced locally from authoritative sources.
- Fork PRs use the same read-only data comparison. Missing, stale, redirected, mutable, or ambiguous inputs fail closed.
- Full protected validation remains separate from generated comparison. Neither path may use candidate bytes as the authority that certifies those same bytes.
- Curated output must not weaken credential, `.env`, `.tmp`, `.n8n-local`, live n8n action, approval, attribution, or local-only safety constraints from the preserved source.
- A generated/public surface must not replace a full working document with a lossy summary. Summaries are allowed only for catalogues, descriptions, navigation tables, or clearly marked overview files.
- Required runtime context for a skill surface must be local, complete enough to use, and traceable to the project source. External links may support provenance or further reading, but must not be required for normal execution.
