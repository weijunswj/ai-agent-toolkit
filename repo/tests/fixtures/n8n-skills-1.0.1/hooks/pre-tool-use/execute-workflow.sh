"Before executing: invoke the n8n-error-handling-official skill via the Skill tool. API-shaped workflows (webhook to respond) handle errors on every fallible node. Map status codes to cause: caller's fault is 4xx, your fault is 5xx. Confirm error branches are wired and respond-to-webhook returns a structured response with the right code on failure paths."
